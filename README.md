# HWID-Finder
A basic HWID Finder for when you need it.

The HWID Will Display the Indentifier In this Format: 
HWID: XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXX

## How to use:
* Run the file and use the Grab HWID Button which will then display your HWID.
* Or you can use the Function I used to Grab the HWID and use it for yourself

## Created and Compiled In:

* [.Net 4.7.2](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download)

## Virus Detections

* I have No clue on why Windows Defender Flags this application as a Virus, If i were to guess though it may be due to me embeddeding my Guna2 DLL Using Costura Fody or maybe something to do with the GrabHWID Function
